Possible Issues:
Make sure your folders and files are structured and in the correct place and order. My index.js file was in startup/index.js instead of startup/client/index.js so localhost:3000 was a blank page until I fixed it.

## Apollo Server
Our server allows graphql and apollo to work together and be available in the client side as an API.
Apollo is going to replace a lot of things in your meteor or express project: 
* API
* Will have mutations to replace your server side stuff (ie routes or meteor methods)

BE will grab database and choose how to make it available to apollo or graphQL in the client side.

Once setup: 
* setup data container that contains a query that pulls what data you want.

Created an apollo server inside our meteor app. Not connect to client just yet.

Resolvers: Hits db and gets data. Db queries.
Type defs: Where you define your schemas.
Mutations: Updates, deletes, and inserts.

grahpiql
http://localhost:3000/graphiql
No schema yet so you will get this error:
Error: Expected undefined to be a GraphQL schema.
